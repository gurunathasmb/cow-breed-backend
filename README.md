# 🐄 Cow Breed Detection Backend

This is a Python-based backend application for detecting cow breeds using image processing techniques powered by OpenCV and machine learning. The backend accepts images of cows and returns the predicted breed.

## 📌 Features

- 🖼️ Image upload and preprocessing
- 🧠 Cow breed prediction using trained ML/CNN model
- 🔍 OpenCV-based feature extraction
- 📤 REST API for frontend integration
- 🧪 Easily extendable for training new breeds
